<strong>Pnyws</strong> is what actually started out as a weekend vacation project for experimenting with [Canvas](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas-class.html), [BoxScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BoxScrollView-class.html) and [RenderSliver](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderSliver-class.html). It turned out to be clean, easy on the eyes and overall has a very smooth feel.
